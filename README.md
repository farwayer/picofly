⚡ **Fast**
  - hand-crafted and optimized for maximum performance
  - perf tests included (soon)  

🤏 **Tiny**
  - **423 bytes** basic version (minified and brotlied)
  - **670 bytes** with React support  

🥧 **Simple**
  - ~130 lines of sparse code
  - ~70 lines for React support (with hook)

🍳 **Easy to use**
  - simple API: just modify data, magic will take care of the rest!
  - unified state: no _state-for-writing_ and _state-for-reading_

⚛️ **React**
  - with **hooks** and **selectors**
  - modern React 18 `useSyncExternalStore` to improve performance with concurrent rendering  
  - state is locked during rendering to avoid subtle errors 

🔋 **Charged**
  - **Map** support (**Set** in plans)
  - **Typescript** definitions
  - can be used with classes
  - architecture agnostic
  - extendable
